## DVC Setup for Data Versioning

This repository demonstrates a **basic DVC (Data Version Control) setup** for managing large datasets efficiently. It provides a **mock example** of how to initialize a DVC repository, track data files, push them to remote storage (e.g., Amazon S3), and revert to previous versions seamlessly.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Provide a *minimal example* of how DVC can be used alongside Git to manage large datasets.
- **Key Features**:
  - Track data with `.dvc` files instead of storing large files directly in Git.
  - Push/pull data from a remote (e.g., Amazon S3).
  - Revert to older data versions easily by combining `git checkout` and `dvc checkout`.

---

## Requirements

- **Git**
- **DVC** (installed via pip or your preferred method)
- **Optional**: An AWS S3 bucket or another remote storage solution for full testing of pushing/pulling data.

## Future Integration with a Full ML Pipeline

- **Versioned Datasets**  
  Keep multiple versions of training or test data for reproducibility.

- **Model Tracking**  
  Store model artifacts (e.g., `.pkl`, `.pt`, `.h5`) using DVC.

- **Automated Training & Evaluation**  
  Use [DVC pipelines](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/dag) or other tools to define ML workflows that chain data processing, training, and evaluation steps.

- **CI/CD Integration**  
  Automate builds, tests, and deployments with GitHub Actions or Jenkins to ensure continuous integration and delivery of your ML models.

- **Team Collaboration**  
  Configure a shared DVC cache on a central server so multiple team members can access the same data without duplicating it in their local environments.
